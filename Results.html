<H1>Conclusion</H1>
<H3>In this experiment, we observed how red cabbage juice reacts by changing color when combined with different substances,
 depending on their pH levels. Highly acidic items like lemon juice, orange juice, Lipton tea, Coca-Cola, and Ronald’s urine 
turned the juice red or pink, indicating a low pH range (0–3). Mildly acidic substances such as milk, yogurt, and Nelson’s urine produced a 
light purple color, suggesting a pH close to 6. On the opposite end, basic substances like chlorine and baking 
soda caused the juice to shift to yellow or turquoise, reflecting a high pH (9–13). Meanwhile, products like soap and alcohol caused little to no 
change in color, keeping it purple and indicating a neutral pH around 7. This experiment clearly demonstrated that red cabbage juice 
is an effective and natural indicator for identifying whether a substance is acidic, neutral, or basic—just by observing the color it turns.</H3>
